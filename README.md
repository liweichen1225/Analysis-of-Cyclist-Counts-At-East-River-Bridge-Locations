# Analysis of Cyclist Counts At East River Bridge Locations


My data is from New York City Department of Transportation (NYC DOT). The Traffic Information Management System (TIMS) collects the count data, to keep count of cyclists entering and leaving Queens, Manhattan and Brooklyn via the East River Bridges. The data includes the date, precipitation, highest temperature, lowest temperature, and the number of cyclists via Brooklyn Bridge, Manhattan Bridge, Williamsburg Bridge and Queensboro Bridge. It can be used to uncover what factors may have an impact on cyclist counts and how do they work.
